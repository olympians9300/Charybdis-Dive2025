Having 2 issues mainly:

1 - DriveBase errors - Generally speaking the erorr states that it cannot find button 3 on the Xbox controller, the issues are documented in the dslogs attached.
2 - Looking for Clarification on the functionality of CommandXboxController so we can use the trigger command and understand how to implement it better.
