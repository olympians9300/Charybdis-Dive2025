(same info as stated in ChiefDelphi Post)
We're having some issues with our code when it comes to 2 issues mainly:

1 - DriveBase errors - Generally speaking the error states that it cannot find button 3 on the Xbox controller on Port 0, the issues are documented in the dslogs attached.

2 - Looking for Clarification on the functionality of CommandXboxController and how it differs with XboxController so we can use the trigger command and understand how to implement it better and make sure we structure it's code/usage properly. We're unsure if it's something to do with the safety mechanisms.

Overall seeking assistance. (sigh)
